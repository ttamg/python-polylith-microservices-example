    "# RabbitMQ worker - Refactor\n",
    "\n",
    "We have three use cases in our app for the queues:\n",
    "1. The API will trigger creation of a new job.  So this will likely be a new connection to RabbitMQ, sending a message to the queue, and then closing the connection.\n",
    "2. The first worker will listen to a message, do a job and then post to another queue.\n",
    "3. The second worker will only listen to a message.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Both 2 and 3 can use blocking connections, in that they can remain open and listen for messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for refactoring we can split this into these building blocks:\n",
    "* A base that creates a connection to RabbitMQ, creates a channel and ensures the right queues are available.\n",
    "* A component for the API to send a new message\n",
    "* A component for the first worker that listens to a message, does a job and posts to another queue\n",
    "* A component for the second worker that listens to a message and then does a job\n",
    "\n",
    "We will have two queues:\n",
    "* `start_fetch` - to trigger a new fetch job\n",
    "* `data_processing` - to trigger a data processing on fetched data"
